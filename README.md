# Sun Keris Enhancer Plugin
The Sun Keris Enhancer plugin for RuneLite adds fun, configurable messages when you or other players use the Keris Partisan of the Sun special attack.

Displays overhead text above players’ heads.

Optionally echoes the message in your chat box.

Messages are configurable and randomly selected from a list.

Works for all visible players on your client.


# Configuration

Open RuneLite → Settings → Plugin Hub → Sun Keris Enhancer.



Example Message List:

I NEED HEALING, WOOOOO!, Solar supremacy, By the power of the Sun!



The plugin picks one message at random each time the special is used.

Whitespace around commas is trimmed automatically.
